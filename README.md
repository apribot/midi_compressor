# midi_compressor
Specifically for the Yamaha EZ-EG, probably others... who knows!
  each string is on a different channel and there is an annoying low velocity 
  'hammer on' note that doesn't play nicely with single-channel synths 
  that don't care about velocity.

Converts all midi in channels to channel 1 -and- converts all out velocities to max
